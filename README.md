## Posture Pro is an advanced posture detection and correction web app that dynamically determines your position in the 3D space of your head and shoulders, and back to accurately remind you when you need to fix your posture.
Posture Pro runs in the background of your various work activities and sends discrete reminders when you need to fix your posture.
